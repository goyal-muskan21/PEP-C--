//time-complexity  ->  it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of length of the input
//space-complexity -> it is the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of 
//length of the input  
//time complexity is usually expressed as a function of the size of the input, typically represented as O(n)
//space complexity is usually expressed as a function of the size of the input, typically represented as
//O(1) - constant time complexity
//O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity
//O(n) - linear time complexity
//O(n log n) - linearithmic time complexity
//O(n^2) - quadratic time complexity
//O(2^n) - exponential time complexity
//O(n!) - factorial time complexity

//descending order of complexity
//O(2^n)
//O(n^3)
//O(n^2)
//O(n log n)
//O(n)
//O(log n)
//O(1) -> for constants

//O(n) also called as upper bound. highest power is taken as the worst case
//O(1) is the best case
//O(n^2) is the worst case
//O(log n) is the best case for sorting algorithms
